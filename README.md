# resu-me

`resu-me` is a command-line tool that generates a PDF resume from a `.toml` configuration file using LaTeX. given a configuration file with various sections (like personal details, summary, etc.), resu-me produces a corresponding .tex file and (optionally) a PDF using pdflatex.

this tool leverages clojure's functional programming features to parse the configuration file and apply the data to a predefined LaTeX resume template.

## requirements and installation

1. install [clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), which is required to run the project, and [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), which is used to manage dependencies and build the project.

2. installing LaTeX is optional but **highly recommended**. if you wish to generate pdfs, a LaTeX distribution (such as pdflatex) is required. Otherwise, you can skip pdf generation and only generate .tex files, and use an online LaTeX editor such as *Overleaf*.

3. clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/bigbookofbug/resu-me
cd resu-me
```

4. install dependencies using leiningen:

```bash
lein deps
```

## usage

you can run `resu-me` directly using leiningen, or you can build a standalone jar file.
running with leiningen requires being in the project directory, and is done like so:

```bash
lein run -- [args]
```

### Building a JAR

to build the project into a standalone JAR file:

```bash
lein uberjar
```

then, you can run the JAR file as follows:

```bash
java -jar path/to/resu-me-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
```

## options

* `--help`, `-h`: displays help and usage information.
* `--config=CONFIG`, `-c CONFIG`: specify the path to the .toml configuration file. If not provided, the program searches for resume.toml in the current directory.
* `--no-pdf`: skip pdf generation. The program will only generate the .tex file without running pdflatex.

## examples

**IMAGES TO COME STAY TUNED**

### example .toml config:

```toml
[Template]
style = "Meta"
template = "bugstyle"

[Personal]
style = "banner"
title = "Bug Bugson"
list = [
    "555-555-5555",
    "ema@ail.com",
    "mywebsite.site"
]

[Summary]
style = "summary"
list = [
	"This is a summary of myself. This summary takes the form of a short paragraph that will go over relevant interests and skillsets. This can be used as a sort of \"elevator pitch\" for oneself, and should provide an overview of what one can do."
]
```
