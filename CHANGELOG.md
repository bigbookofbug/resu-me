##  [0.1.1] - 2024-09-18

this is the first official "testing" release of the `resu-me` project. This release introduces the following key features:

### added
- **three resume templates**: users can now choose between three different resume styles:
  - `bugstyle`
  - `star rover`
  - `stylish`

- **example toml files**: the release includes three example `.toml` configuration files located in the `resources` section, named after each resume template.

- **example tex files**: along with the toml files, three example `.tex` files are included, corresponding to the templates to demonstrate how resumes will be formatted.

### notes

- expect frequent and potentially breaking changes on the `master` branch as the project is still under development. stable changes will be pushed to the `stable` branch after thorough testing.
